Here is a query to find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:

SELECT D.country,
	COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customer.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id

LEFT JOIN
(SELECT A.customer_id AS customer_ID,
A.first_name AS customer_first_name,
A.last_name AS customer_last_name,
D.country AS country,
C.city AS city,
SUM(E.amount) AS top_5_customer
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora',
              'Tokat',
              'Tarsus',
              'Atlixco',
              'Emeishan',
              'Pontianak',
              'Shimoga',
              'Aparecida de Goinia',
              'Zalantun',
              'Taguig')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY top_5_customer DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customer
ON D.country= top_5_customer.country

GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC

LIMIT 5;
