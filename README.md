# Rockbuster_SQL project

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing competition from streaming services, Rockbuster Stealth's management team planned to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. The purpose of this data analysis project was to assist with the launch strategy for the new online video service.

The data for this project was sourced from Rockbuster's relational database, which contained linked tables from all departments.

The findings were presented to the board in a [Tableau Storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/odette1054/viz/RockbusterOnlineLaunchStrategy/RockbusterAnalysis). **N.B.** Please view in full screen mode.
